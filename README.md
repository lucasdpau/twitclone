# twitclone
This is a Twitter clone that I made to practice my development and coding skills.

The main features I want to replicate are making accounts, creating posts, replying to posts, and liking posts.

I also implemented hashtags, and the ability to follow other users. There is an option to delete posts if you are the author.

Liking/unliking posts is done with AJAX.
